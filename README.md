# Calculator App
A simple calculator app made with rust.

## Libraries
*Egui* 
 - Used for simple yet intuitive ui
 - Allows for widgets, easy window creation, and easy formatting

*Meval*
  - Used for math operations
  - By default uses pemdas
  - Allows for easier string input to equations


## Project Aim
I made this project as I wanted to dip my hands into making a ui based app and I figured a calculator is the easiest to work with
